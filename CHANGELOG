## [0.1.0]
### Initial release
Started in 2014 as a hobby project, rirc has been a fully useable,
albeit basic, IRC client since it's early inception. This version
marks an initial release supporting a basic subset of the IRC
protocol and client management features one would expect in everyday
usage.
